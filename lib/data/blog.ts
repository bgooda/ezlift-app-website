      A deload week is a planned reduction in training volume or intensity that helps your body recover and adapt to the stress of training.

      ## What is a Deload Week?

      A deload week is like pressing the reset button on your training. It's a strategic reduction in training volume, intensity, or both, typically lasting 5-7 days.

      ## Benefits of Deloading

      1. **Physical Recovery**
         - Allows joints and connective tissue to recover
         - Reduces accumulated fatigue
         - Prevents overuse injuries

      2. **Mental Recovery**
         - Reduces psychological fatigue
         - Maintains motivation
         - Prevents burnout

      ## How to Implement a Deload

      Here's a great video explaining deload strategies:

      ## When to Deload

      - Every 4-8 weeks of training
      - When performance decreases
      - When motivation drops significantly
      - Before competition or max testing

      Meal timing is often overcomplicated in the fitness industry. Let's break down what really matters and what's just myth.

      ## The Basics of Meal Timing

      The most important factors in nutrition are:
      1. Total daily calories
      2. Macronutrient distribution
      3. Food quality
      4. Consistency

      ## Pre-Workout Nutrition

      Eat 2-3 hours before training:
      - Complex carbohydrates
      - Moderate protein
      - Low fat
      - Easy to digest

      ## Post-Workout Nutrition

      The "anabolic window" isn't as crucial as once thought:
      - Eat within 2 hours
      - Prioritize protein and carbs
      - Stay hydrated

      ## Daily Meal Distribution

      - 3-5 meals per day
      - Protein every 3-4 hours
      - Adjust timing to your schedule

      Remember: Consistency with your overall diet is more important than perfect timing!
